 a successful Central California entrepreneur.Its first published use is credited to Don Hoefler, a friend
 of Vaerst's, who used the phrase as the title of a series of articles in the weekly trade newspaper Electronic News.
 The series, entitled "Silicon Valley in the USA", began in the paper's issue dated January 11, 1971. The term did 
not become widely known and used, however, until the early 1980s, essentially synonymous with the introduction of
 the IBM PC and numerous related hardware and software products to the consumer market. Valley refers to
 the Santa Clara Valley, located at the southern end of San Francisco Bay, while Silicon refers to the
 high concentration of companies involved in the semiconductor (silicon is used to create most semiconductors
 commercially) and computer industries that were concentrated in the area. These firms slowly replaced the
 orchards which gave the area its initial nickname, the Valley of Heart's Delight.
